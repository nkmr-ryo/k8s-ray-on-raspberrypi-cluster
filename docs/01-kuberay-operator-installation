# KubeRay Operator Installation

This section explains how to install the **KubeRay Operator** on a Kubernetes cluster.

Most of the steps follow the official documentation:  
[KubeRay Operator Installation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/getting-started/kuberay-operator-installation.html)  
In addition, this document includes notes specific to running KubeRay on a **Raspberry Pi 5 (ARM64) Kubernetes cluster**.

## Step 1: Install the KubeRay Operator

There are two ways to install the KubeRay Operator:

1. **Using Helm (recommended)**
2. **Using Kustomize**

The Ray official documentation recommends Helm, so this example uses the Helm method.

Run the following commands to install the operator (version `1.5.0`):

```bash
helm repo add kuberay https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay-helm/
helm repo update

# Install both CRDs and the KubeRay Operator v1.5.0
helm install kuberay-operator kuberay/kuberay-operator --version 1.5.0
```

## Step 2: Validate Installation
Confirm that the operator Pod is running in the **default** namespace:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Expected output:

```bash
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kuberay-operator-5c575cccb6-2659c   1/1     Running   0          21s
```

If the pod shows **Running** and **1/1**, the installation was successful.
